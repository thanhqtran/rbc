In this code:

- `solution_christiano` : solution of log-linearized RBC model using methods of undetermined coefficients
- `solution_bk`: solution of a log-linearized RBC model using Blanchard-Kahn method. The solution requires a Schur decomposition (`qzschur.m`) and reordering of the decomposed matrices based on the eigenvalues.
